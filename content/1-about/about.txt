## Our Mission
Formed in 1996, FOSS is a 501(c)3 charity charged with the goal of raising money to ensure Slavens students don’t lose out on a well-rounded education featuring key courses including art, music, foreign language and STEM.

## What We Do
Giving our kids access to these extras not only makes for a better school experience, but helps create future leaders and great thinkers. Recent FOSS funding includes paying the salary of our STEM facilitator, as well as providing a new sound system for the gym/auditorium, band scholarships, Spanish books and art festival support, among other gifts.

## What We Need
FOSS is dedicated to giving the extras to every child, every day but we can’t do it without every family participating. We recommend $150 per student (that’s less than $1 per day), but no donation is too small. If we all give what we can, we will reach our annual goal!
